### 1. Introduction

Weleba Tech (“we”, “our”, “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you interact with our website, Marketing CRM Data applications (desktop, web, and mobile), demo-request forms, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).

- **Legitimate interests** – to maintain, secure, and improve our platforms.

### 7. Security

We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (including access controls, encryption, and monitoring) to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security, but we continuously improve our defenses.

### 8. International Transfers

Data may be stored and processed in countries where we or our service providers operate. When transferring data internationally, we use appropriate safeguards such as contractual clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms.

### 11. Third-Party Links

Our website or applications may contain links to third-party sites. We are not responsible for their privacy practices, so we encourage you to review their policies independently.

### 12. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date above and, if appropriate, notify you through our Services or via email. Continued use of the Services after changes indicates acceptance.
